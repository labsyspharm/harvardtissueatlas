name: BRCA1/2 Cancer Atlas
summary: The BRAC1/2 Cancer Atlas involves leading cancer centers across the US focused on collecting and analyzing diverse genomic and imaging on BRAC1/2 breast and ovarian cancers. The goal of the effort is to understand pre-cancer states, develop new diagnostics that detect cancer before it spreads, and improve disease management and prevention strategies.

description: The mutations that cause cancer often arise spontaneously in somatic tissues but some are heritable. Among these mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BReast CAncer gene 1&2) stand out as having relatively high prevalence and causing a substantial increase in a variety of cancers including those of the breast, ovaries, pancreas and prostate. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in the repair of damaged DNA but the precise events that initiate tumor formation are not fully understood.

**funding**:
This research is funded by the [Gray Foundation Basser Initiative](https://www.grayfoundation.org/program-areas/basser/). The Atlas is expected to launch in Summer 2022.

**Principal Investigators**:
  -  Sandro Santagata, MD PhD, Associate Professor of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School
  -  Peter Sorger, PhD. Professor of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School
