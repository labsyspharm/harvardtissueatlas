    description: Precision medicine is critically dependent on better methods for diagnosing and staging disease and predicting drug response. Histopathology using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained tissue - not genomics – remains the primary diagnostic method in cancer. Recently developed highly-multiplexed tissue imaging methods promise to enhance research studies and clinical practice with precise, spatially-resolved, single-cell data. Here we describe the “Orion” platform for collecting H&E and high-plex immunofluorescence images from the same cells in a whole-slide format suitable for diagnosis. Using a retrospective cohort of 74 colorectal cancer resections, we show that IF and H&E images provide human experts and machine learning algorithms with complementary information that can be used to generate interpretable, multiplexed image-based models predictive of progression-free survival. Combining models of immune infiltration and tumor-intrinsic features achieves a nearly 20-fold discrimination between rapid and slow (or no) progression, demonstrating the ability of multi-modal tissue imaging to generate high-performance biomarkers.

### Key Findings:
- The Orion platform rapidly collects 18-plex immunofluorescence (IF) and diagnostic-grade H&E images from the same cells

- Complementing H&E with IF (i.e., multimodal imaging) provides greater insight into the molecular features of colorectal cancer samples

- Machine learning models trained on the multimodal and clinical data predict progression-free survival

- Analyzing multimodal imaging using machine learning / artificial intelligence methods reveals biomarkers not discoverable by other means
