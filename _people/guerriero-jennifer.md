Jennifer Guerriero, PhD is a Core Member of the Ludwig Tumor Atlas Team and Director of the Breast Immunology Laboratory in the Women’s Cancer Program at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Her lab at Brigham and Women’s Hospital focuses on unraveling the complexity of tissue associated macrophages (TAMs). She and her group study the functions, regulation, and developmental identities of TAMs and perform basic science and translational experiments aimed at identifying clinically effective strategies for targeting TAMs, thereby promoting T-cell activation and weakening the immune-suppressive properties of the tumor microenvironment.
